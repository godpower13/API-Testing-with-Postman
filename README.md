# API-Testing-with-Postman

Welcome to the API Testing Project! This repository contains a comprehensive suite of automated API tests designed to ensure the robustness and reliability of our application endpoints. We leverage Postman's powerful capabilities for creating and managing our test collections. To automate the execution of these tests, we utilize Newman, Postman's command-line tool, which allows us to integrate API testing seamlessly into our CI/CD pipeline. Our test results are meticulously reported using the Allure Reporter, providing clear and actionable insights into the API performance and behavior. The workflow is designed to run these tests automatically on every push and pull request to the main branch, ensuring continuous quality assurance. Detailed test reports are generated and archived as artifacts, making it easy to review and track test outcomes over time. This setup not only streamlines our testing process but also ensures that our APIs remain reliable and performant.

# Capabilities

This project provides a robust and automated API testing framework using Postman and Newman, seamlessly integrated into a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions. It ensures continuous testing and validation of API endpoints on every code change. Detailed test results are generated and reported using the Allure Reporter, offering clear insights into API performance and reliability. The automated workflow helps maintain high-quality APIs by catching issues early and providing actionable feedback, thus enhancing the overall development process.

# Run Tests Locally

- `npm run test` : Run tests cases and generates report files.
- `npm run generate-report` : Starts local server to provide the test results.
